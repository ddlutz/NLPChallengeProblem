AS3,n10,q2,Q,E,[how] do the people feel 
AS3,n10,q2,A,E,sp they are um sp the two people at the bottom might feel as if it's you know sp pretty strange sp pretty sp bizarre to see such a thing like that sp and if they open the parachute they may sp see you know sp animal cruelty and sp they might think that's sp unjust sp um sp or they could just be just astonished sp period in general sp but the person at the top sp is sp solely just the latter sp astonished so he's willing to you know sp perform this feat
AS3,n10,q3,Q,E,and why would the people be surprised
AS3,n10,q3,A,E,because it's sp it isn't typical to sp be seeing bird houses sp dropped from a sp tall sp ledge sp or sp a sp bird catcher sp and especially for the latter it's sp one could perhaps sp even argue that it's totally totally unethical
AS3,n10,q4,Q,M,and is it realistic for an egg to hatch while dropping
AS3,n10,q4,A,M,uh {sl} sp i suppose so {sl} sp i mean that probably discredits the {sl} um previous questions i had about my uh sp uh i i mean about this picture but sp it isn't probable sp that from that point on the bird could be able to fly out because {sl} sp uh they just don't have that strength yet
TD1,n10,q1,Q,M,[what] are they dropping off the ledge
TD1,n10,q1,A,M,um sp i've sp i've seen this image before it's uh sp it's an egg drop sp but the egg's supposed to hatch mid sp drop sp because the drop is sp being done so carefully i think
TD1,n10,q2,Q,E,how do the people feel
TD1,n10,q2,A,E,sp um sp the person on top probably feels some sort of pride sp because his sp i guess invention worked perfectly sp while the people on the bottom would be sp surprised kind of shocked that this sp they didn't expect a sp a bird to i mean to pop out of the egg sp but it did sp so surprised
TD1,n10,q3,Q,E,why would the people be surprised
TD1,n10,q3,A,E,sp um {sl} normally when you do an egg drop you use {sl} eggs that {sl} sp are unfertilized that won't sp crack into a bird sp especially during the egg drop sp {sl} but {sl} this seems to just be a {br} i can't sp think of the word sp it's sp defying what normally happens sp uh sp it's abnormal they're sp shocked
TD1,n10,q4,Q,M,and is it realistic for an egg to sp hatch while dropping
TD1,n10,q4,A,M,sp um it sp could happen i sp highly doubt that it ever has happened sp but if you sp put a fertile egg in a parachute and let it drop sp very slowly it sp might happen sp i don't think that it ever has happened sp so sp it's not very realistic
TD2,n10,q1,Q,M,[what] are they dropping off sp the ledge
TD2,n10,q1,A,M,sp um it sp says chirp chirp sp um oh but that's just a bird off sp off to the side sp crack sp um sp {ls} sp let's see sp i don't know it looks to be some sp contraption with um sp with a parachute to somehow sp stop sp um sp to somehow make the impact sp uh sp not as bad sp uh to sp to soften the impact when it hits the ground sp um {ls} sp what they why they would be trying to soften the impact i'm not sure sp um sp crack maybe makes me think of an egg so maybe they're doing some sort of competition where they sp where they sp make sp contraptions to throw an egg sp off sp off a sp high altitude and try to make it not sp um sp break
TD2,n10,q2,Q,E,how do the people feel
TD2,n10,q2,A,E,um {sl} um sp the only really real indication of their feelings is that they're looking up at sp the uh sp at sp at the the dropping sp thing whatever it may be sp and so they're not completely apathetic to it um sp they're sp either sp you can tell they have sp they're somewhat interested in what's going on sp um {sl} but other than that sp uh you really can't tell anything sp like they have sp blank faces um sp you can really just tell by their body sp uh sp stance sp like that they're looking at it and that's about it sp they sp they could be kind of interested but not like sp really care that much sp but basically the only thing you know is that they're not completely apathetic sp about what's going on
TD2,n10,q3,Q,E,why would the people be surprised
TD2,n10,q3,A,E,sp um {sl} oh sp oh it seems like a uh sp i guess the bird sp i guess the sp the bird flew sp through the sp the apparatus sp um sp and cracked something sp um or maybe hit it sp and they were surprised that that a bird sp hit it ok i guess sp that's what it seems like
TD2,n10,q4,Q,M,and is it realistic for an egg to hatch while dropping
TD2,n10,q4,A,M,sp oh ok sp um no because it's a much {lg} sp it's a much slower um sp it's a much slower process than sp that it looks it looks like that guy is maybe sp what twenty five thirty feet up sp and there's no way that a bird would have time to hatch on the way down the the guy up there would have already noticed sp um sp so sp yeah no that's completely unrealistic
TD3,n10,q1,Q,M,what are they dropping off the ledge
TD3,n10,q1,A,M,parach- sp parachutes with birds in them {sl} or just parachutes sp of things
TD3,n10,q2,Q,E,and how do the people feel
TD3,n10,q2,A,E,sp the person dropping them is just dropping them and sp the sp people at the bottom are sp kinda just observing what's going on
TD3,n10,q3,Q,E,why would the people be surprised
TD3,n10,q3,A,E,it's not every day you see someone just dropping parachutes with boxes sp attached to them sp off a ledge {sl} also there's a bird sp not sure what the bird's doing there
TD3,n10,q4,Q,M,and is it realistic for an egg to hatch while dropping
TD3,n10,q4,A,M,probably not {sl} sp certainly not for the bird to be able to fly right out of the egg
AS2,n12,q1,Q,E,what's going on in this picture
AS2,n12,q1,A,E,mm sp {sl} i don't know
AS2,n12,q2,Q,M,what's the profession of the man on the left sp
AS2,n12,q2,A,M,uh {sl} uh sp i guess like a sp like a medic in like the navy or sp something
AS2,n12,q3,Q,E,what are the relationships sp of the people in this picture
AS2,n12,q3,A,E,mm {sl} sp mm {sl} uh the woman's sp probably sp the daughter of sp uh sp the old man sp uh the old man sp i'm guessing is a sp like a veteran
AS2,n12,q4,Q,M,and approximately how old is each person
AS2,n12,q4,A,M,mm {sl} i sp wanna sp say like {sl} i sp wanna say the younger sp man and {sl} uh the woman are sp like both in sp their forties and {sl} the older man {sl} like maybe sp seventies eighties
AS3,n12,q1,Q,E,what is going on in this sp picture
AS3,n12,q1,A,E,sp uh sp it's like an sp emt sp sort of training seminar in which there is like a sp emt professional the african american sp uh individual who is trying to sp lecture sp the other two individuals on how to sp uh sp how to train as an emt or simply could just be an emt sp uh providing information to sp the man in the center about what his condition was which resulted in an emt showing up to sp resuscitate him
AS3,n12,q2,Q,M,what is sp the profession of the man on the left
AS3,n12,q2,A,M,sp {sl} i sp believe emt stands for emergency sp medical trainer so he's basically sp he's not a doctor sp but he's basically sort of like sp what is analogous to police and swat sp he's just basically a sp a quick responder to somebody who is in sp despair and need sp in this case medically
AS3,n12,q3,Q,E,what are the relationships of the people in this picture
AS3,n12,q3,A,E,sp uh sp well the african american man he's just basically sp emt so he has no blood relation to the sp other two individuals so i'm gonna think that the other two individuals sp the man is the father and the woman is the daughter
AS3,n12,q4,Q,M,and approximately how old is each person
AS3,n12,q4,A,M,sp i'd say the african american man might be you sp know early forties sp the man in the center he's probably like sp uh sp like sp seventies or eighties even sp and the girl on the right she's sp like sp late thirties
TD1,n12,q1,Q,E,what is going on in this picture
TD1,n12,q1,A,E,hm {sl} um sp {sl} i'm guessing that {sl} a navy er a navy officer is contracting {sl} sp a couple of sp engineers to help sp build sp {sl} sp some kind of sp boat or {sl} maybe airplane sp some sp military thing {sl} based on his uh {sl} official looking patches on his shoulders
TD1,n12,q2,Q,M,so what is the profession of the man on the left
TD1,n12,q2,A,M,um {sl} he looks like he would be maybe a military {sl} he sp he'd have some relation to the military but he wouldn't actually be fighting he'd more be {sl} sp helping out logistically trying to get {sl} troops and ammo and sp weapons to the front line and where it needs to be
TD1,n12,q3,Q,E,what are the relationships of the people in this sp picture
TD1,n12,q3,A,E,um sp i'm guessing they've all probably worked together in the past on sp other projects sp but um sp i think they just have a professional relationship
TD1,n12,q4,Q,M,and approximately how old is each person
TD1,n12,q4,A,M,uh the man on the left is probably in his sp mid thirties sp maybe forties sp the man in the middle is probably in his sp seventies to eighties sp and the woman on her right is probably in her {sl} maybe sp probably somewhere between thirty and fifty
TD2,n12,q1,Q,E,what is going on in this sp picture
TD2,n12,q1,A,E,um {sl} sp so it looks as if um someone in the military sp is sp showing {sl} these other two people {sl} sp some sort of document sp or picture sp um {sl} sp it's it's very similar to the other picture i saw sp um {sl} but sp he's sp oh and he's wearing a stethoscope so he's obviously some sort of medical unit in the military um sp maybe not an m d sp um sp but sp um sp some sort of medical unit in the in the military sp um sp and it looks like sp it looks like the two people on the right are kind of excited about what they're seeing sp um {sl} it's it's not just it's it sp looks to be not just one result because the old man is uh sp pointing sp at something specific on on the uh picture sp as if to sp um {sl} to notice something specific in it sp um {sl} and uh sp that's about it
TD2,n12,q2,Q,M,what is the profession of the man on the left
TD2,n12,q2,A,M,um {sl} sp he sp he sp looks to be some sort sp of military sp medical personnel sp um sp but it he's he's still wearing his uniform so the that i i question whether um sp whether sp you know full full on full blown uh doctors sp would sp would still be wearing their uh short sleeved uniform sp um uh sp while while practicing sp um sp even if they are in the military sp um so my guess is he's he's some some lesser form of sp of medical personnel in in the military
TD2,n12,q3,Q,E,what are the relationships of the people in this picture
TD2,n12,q3,A,E,sp i could see um the old man being sp uh the father sp of sp of the uh woman in the green sp um i think that's most likely true sp um {sl} and sp and then obviously sp um {sl} sp obviously the military unit is some some type of uh sp some type of sp uh care provider for these two sp uh whether sp whether she's in the military or he's in or he's a veteran sp um sp or maybe still in the military i guess sp um sp so
TD2,n12,q4,Q,M,and approximately how old is each person
TD2,n12,q4,A,M,sp um sp the man on the left seems to be sp forty maybe maybe early forties sp um sp late thirties maybe sp uh sp the woman on the right seems to be sp uh sp maybe sp thirty sp um sp or or a little younger sp um the man seems to be around sixty five {sl} sixty five maybe maybe seventy
TD3,n12,q1,Q,E,what is going on in this picture
TD3,n12,q1,A,E,um {sl} naval officer sp is sp showing off some sort of plan or design sp or sp photograph sp to {sl} the people on the right
TD3,n12,q2,Q,M,and what is sp the profession of the man on the left sp
TD3,n12,q2,A,M,i'm pretty sure he's navy {sl} definitely military
TD3,n12,q3,Q,E,what are the relationships of the people in this picture
TD3,n12,q3,A,E,not sure i'd sp like to skip that one
TD3,n12,q4,Q,M,and approximately how old is each person
TD3,n12,q4,A,M,if i had to guess sp {sl} i'd say sp man on the left is sp in his sp twenties sp er mid late twenties or sp thirties sp {sl} um {sl} person in the middle is in his seventies {sl} person on the right is sp in her forties
AS2,n13,q1,Q,E,what has just sp happened
AS2,n13,q1,A,E,mm {sl} mm sp it's been sp well sp it's been a while since i've {sl} seen toy story sp two sp so uh i sp mean {sl} uh {sl} i think {sl} sp uh i think i think he {sl} like sp woody like sp just sp showed up and they're {sl} like excited to see him sp i sp don't don't remember

AS3,n13,q1,Q,E,what has just sp happened
AS3,n13,q1,A,E,sp uh well i don't know sp this movie very well but i can probably think that like uh sp {sl} sp woody sp i know his character woody might have saven the day from some sp catastrophe simple as that
AS3,n13,q2,Q,E,how do the toys feel
AS3,n13,q2,A,E,uh they're pretty sp they're pretty uh sp excited to see about woody uh sp being a hero and all that sp no surprise there
AS3,n13,q3,Q,M,how many female toys are in this picture
AS3,n13,q3,A,M,sp i believe the sp pig is male and as is the horse sp so judging on that basis i'm gonna say three
AS3,n13,q4,Q,M,and what are the names of some of the toys
AS3,n13,q4,A,M,um {sl} i know that there is mr potato head and {sl} sp presumably mrs potato head sp woody sp barbie doll {sl} that's it
TD1,n13,q1,Q,E,so what has just happened here
TD1,n13,q1,A,E,sp um something is being celebrated sp uh sp this sp is sp from toy story so it looks like woody sp did something good sp or sp i'm not sure which toy story this is from {sl} but sp mm- sp everyone is celebrating something sp good just happened
TD1,n13,q2,Q,E,so how do the toys feel

TD2,n13,q1,Q,E,what has just happened
TD2,n13,q1,A,E,um sp {sl} well i can't remember the movie very well sp but uh sp something good has obviously happened as sp as they all seem to be celebrating um sp and the fact that they're holding woody up sp indicates that he's sp he's the one that that did most of the uh sp he's the one that that accomplished most of of of the uh sp of the thing that happened uh sp you know he's the hero of the day they sp they're holding him up sp um sp while all of them had something to gain sp um sp from what happened it seems as if he's he uh sp he's the hero of the day
